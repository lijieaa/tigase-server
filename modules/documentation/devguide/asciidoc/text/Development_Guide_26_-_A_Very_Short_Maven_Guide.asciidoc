== Snapshot Compilation and Snapshot Package Generation
- +mvn compile+ - compilation of the snapshot package
- +mvn package+ - create snapshot jar file
- +mvn install+ - install in local repository shanpshot jar file
- +mvn deploy+ - deploy to the remote repository snapshot jar file

== Release Compilation, Generation

- +mvn release:prepare+ prepare the project for a new version release
- +mvn release:perform+ execute new version release generation

== Generating tar.gz, tar.bz2 File With Sources Only
