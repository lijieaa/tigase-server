If you want to write code for *Tigase* server we recommend the use of link:http://www.eclipse.org/[Eclipse]. Here is a guide how to start working on source code using this IDE.

All you need to start is:

. Installed and working copy of link:http://www.eclipse.org/[Eclipse]
. Installed and working copy of link:http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html[Java Development Kit (JDK)].
. Installed and working link:http://subclipse.tigris.org/[Subclipse] plugin for Eclipse.


== JDK-1.6.0 Setup
After installation JDK-1.6.0 in your operating system, run Eclipse and select Window/Preferences.

In section Java/Installed JREs press *Add* button. In the new opened window enter path to installed JDK-6. In this case it is */opt/jdk1.6.0*. It also good to set name to *sun-jdk-1.6.0*.

== Subclipse Installation
As Eclipse doesn't contain built-in support for Subversion repositories you have to add the Subclipse plugin.  Detailed instruction for Subclipse installation is on page:

link:http://subclipse.tigris.org/install.html[subclipse.tigris.org/install.html].

Alternatively you may use the link:http://marketplace.eclipse.org/marketplace-client-intro[Eclipse Marketplace Client].

== Project Import
From menu File in Eclipse execute *Import*. Next, highlight section *Team/Team
Project Set* and press *Next*.

Enter file name *tigase-server.psf* in field *File* and press *Finish*.

The file is attached to this article.

You will have to add and manipulate Eclipse configuration files on your own as we do not maintain those on the file repository.

That's it. Start hacking now!
