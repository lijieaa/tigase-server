To generate installer:

. Install chosen version of link:http://izpack.org/[IzPack] including source code.
. In order to compile custom Tigase panels you need to first compile link:http://izpack.org/[IzPack] classes. You can use the included +build.xml+ which is in the src directory of link:http://izpack.org/[IzPack] install. Just enter this dir and type:

[source,bash]
ant all

. Depending on the IzPack version classes will be compiled directly into the +src/lib+ directory or +_build+ directory of link:http://izpack.org/[IzPack]. You may need to tweak the +build.xml+ file which is in the same dir as the +readme+ and point to the directory where link:http://izpack.org/[IzPack] compiled classes reside.

[source,java]
-----
<!-- fragment -->
<classpath>
  <pathelement location="java"/>

  <!-- tweak below fragment -->
  <pathelement location="${installer.path}/_build"/>

  <pathelement location="${installer.path}/bin/panels/TargetPanel.jar"/>
</classpath>
-----
. Make sure that the bin/panels directory of link:http://izpack.org/[IzPack] is writable by +generate-installer.sh+ script. Compiled custom panels will be placed here before running installer compiler.
. Modify the +script/generate-installer.sh+. Change the +IZPACK_DIR+ variable to point to the link:http://izpack.org/[IzPack] instalation directory e.g.
+
[source,bash]
-----
IZPACK_DIR="/usr/local/IzPack421"
-----
. To start the installation process run the +scripts/generate-installer.sh+ file you will find in the main server source code directory. You should start it from the server root dir.
. Generated files (jar and exe) will be placed in the packages dir of Tigase codebase.
