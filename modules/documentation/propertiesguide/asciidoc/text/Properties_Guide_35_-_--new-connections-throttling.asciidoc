*Default value:* +5222:200,5223:50,5269:100,5280:1000+

*Example:* +--new-connections-throttling = 5222:100+

*Possible values:* 'a list of port numbers with throttling thresholds as integer.'

*Description:* The property allows you to limit how many new users' connection per second the server accepts on a particular port. Connections established within the limit are processed normally, all others are simply disconnected. This allows you to avoid server overload in case there is a huge number of users trying to connect at the same time. Mostly this happens after a server restart.

The property value is a list of comma separated port settings. Each port setting is formatted in a following way: +PORT_NO:LIMIT_VAL+

*Available since:* 5.1.0
