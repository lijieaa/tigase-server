*Default value:* 'none'

*Example:* +--debug = server,xmpp.impl+

*Possible values:* 'comma separated list of Tigase\'s package names.'

*Description:* The +--debug+ property is used to turn on the debug log for the selected Tigase package. For example if you want to turn debug logs on for the +tigase.server+ package, then you have to use the +--debug server+ parameter. If you have any problems with your server the best way to get help from the Tigase team is to generate configuration with '--debug = server' and run the server. Then from the +logs/tigase-console.log+ log file I can provide the best information for us to provide assistance. More details about server logging and adjusting logging level is described in the Debugging Tigase article in the admin guide.

*Available since:* 2.0.0
