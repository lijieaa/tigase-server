*Default value:* +etc/bosh-extra-headers.txt+

*Example:* +--bosh-extra-headers-file = /path/to/file.txt+

*Possible values:* 'path to a file on the filesystem.'

*Description:* This property allows you to specify a path to a text file with additional HTTP headers which will be sent to a Bosh client with each request. This gives some extra flexibility for Bosh clients running on some systems with special requirements for the HTTP headers and some additional settings.

By default a file distributed with the installation contains following content:

[source,bash]
-----
Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *
Access-Control-Allow-Methods: GET, POST, OPTIONS
Access-Control-Allow-Headers: Content-Type
Access-Control-Max-Age: 86400
-----

This can be modified, removed or replaced with a different content on your installation.

*Available since:* 5.1.0
