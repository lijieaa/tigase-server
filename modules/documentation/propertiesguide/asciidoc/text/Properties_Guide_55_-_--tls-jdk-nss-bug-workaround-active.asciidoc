*Description:* This is a workaround for TLS/SSL bug in new JDK7 using the native library for keys generation and connection encryption used with new version of nss library.

This caused a number of problems with Tigase installed on systems with JDK7 and the new library installed, such as hanging connections, or broken SSL/TLS. There is some information on our link:https://projects.tigase.org/projects/tigase-server/wiki/Tigase_with_OpenJDK7_with_OpenSSL_101[wiki page]. Our earlier suggestion was to avoid using either JDK7 or the problematic native library. Now we have a proper fix/workaround which allows you to run Tigase with JDK7.
