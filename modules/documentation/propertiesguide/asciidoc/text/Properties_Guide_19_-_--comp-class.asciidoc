*Default value:* 'depends on component.'

*Example:* +--comp-class-1 = tigase.muc.MUCComponent+

*Possible values:* 'class name.'

*Description:* This property is used to load an extra component to the server.  Normally this parameter is used if you want to load a component which is not included in the +config-type+ you use. You can, of course, load more than just one component using parameters: +--comp-class-2+, +--comp-class-3+ and so on....
Let's say you want to load the MUC component and the class name for the component is: +tigase.muc.MUCService+. The line in the properties file should look like:

[source,bash]
