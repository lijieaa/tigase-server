*Possible values:* +true|false+

*Description:* This property activates a workaround for a bug in EJabberd in it's s2s implementation. EJabberd does not send dialback in stream features after TLS handshaking even if the dialback is expected/needed. This results in unusable connection as EJabberd does not accept any packets on this connection either. The workaround is enabled by default right now until the EJabberd version without the bug is popular enough. A disadvantage of the workaround is that dialback is always performed even if the SSL certificate is fully trusted and in theory this dialback could be avoided.

*Available since:* 5.1.0
