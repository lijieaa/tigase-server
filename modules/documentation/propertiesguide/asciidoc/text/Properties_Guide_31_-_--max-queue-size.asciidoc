*Default value:* 'depends on RAM size.'

*Example:* +--max-queue-size = 10000+

*Possible values:* 'integer number.'

*Description:* The +--max-queue-size+ property sets internal queues maximum size to a specified value. By default Tigase sets the queue size depending on the maximum available memory to the Tigase server process. It set's 1000 for each 100MB memory assigned for JVM. This is enough for most cases. If you have however, an extremely busy service with Pubsub or MUC component generating huge number of packets (presence or messages) this size should be equal or bigger to the maximum expected number of packets generated by the component in a single request. Otherwise Tigase may drop packets that it is unable to process.

*Available since:* 5.1.0
