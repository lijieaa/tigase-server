*Default value:* +false+

*Example:* +--bosh-close-connection = true+

*Possible values:* +true|false+

*Description:* This property globally disables Bosh keep-alive support for Tigase server. It causes the Bosh connection manager to force close the HTTP connection each time data is sent to the Bosh client. To continue communication the client must open a new HTTP connection.

This setting is rarely required but on installations where the client cannot control/disable keep-alive Bosh connections and keep-alive does not work correctly for some reason.

*Available since:* 5.1.0
