*Default value:* +etc/cross-domain-policy.xml+

*Example:* +--cross-domain-policy-file = /path/to/cross-domain-policy.xml+

*Possible values:* 'path to a file on the filesystem.'

*Description:* This property allows you to set a path to a file with cross domain access policy for flash based clients. This is a standard XML file which is sent to the flash client upon request.

A default file distributed with Tigase installations allows for full access for all. This is good enough for most use cases but it can be changed by simply editing the file.

*Available since:* 5.1.0
