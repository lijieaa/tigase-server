*Default value:* +default+

*Example:* +--ssl-def-cert-domain =+

*Possible values:* 'DNS domain name.'

*Description:* This property allows you to specify a default alias/domain name for certificate. It is mostly used to load certificates for unknown domain names during the SSL negotiation. Unlike in TLS protocol where the domain name is known at the handshaking time, for SSL domain name is not known, therefore, the server does not know which certificate to use. Specifying a domain name in this property allows you to use a certificate for a specific domain in such case. This property value is also sometimes used if there is no certificate for one of virtual domains and the container does not automatically generate a self-signed certificate, then it can use a default one.

*Available since:* 5.1.0
