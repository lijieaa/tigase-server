The schema upgrade is very simple and safe but make sure the current database schema is in version 4.0.

Assumptions:

. *tigasedb* is a database name
. *tigase_user* is a database user name
. *mypass* is database user password

First things first - make a database backup:

[source,sh]
-----
mysqldump -u tigase_user -pmypass tigasedb > tigasedb_dump.sql
-----

If you need to restore database for any reason execute following commands:

[source,sh]
-----
msyqladmin -u tigase_user -pmypass drop tigasedb
mysqladmin -u tigase_user -pmypass create tigasedb
mysql -u tigase_user -pmypass tigasedb < tigasedb_dump.sql
-----

_Note! You may be required to use root user and his password to execute mysqladmin commands._

Now we can run schema upgrade script

[source,sh]
-----
mysql -u tigase_user -pmypass tigasedb < database/mysql-schema-upgrade-to-5-1.sql
-----
